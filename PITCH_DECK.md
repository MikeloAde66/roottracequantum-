### RootTrace Quantum
**Healing Historical Trauma Through Quantum Computing**

*The first quantum-powered ancestral reconnection platform for the African diaspora*

Proto Studios / Digital Digest Global
Founded: 2025
Seeking: $2M Seed Round

# Slide 2: The Problem

## 40 Million African Americans Don't Know Their Ancestral Origins

**The Diaspora Wound:**
- Slave trade deliberately destroyed family records
- Surnames were assigned by slaveholders
- Cultural traditions fragmented across generations
- Medical history unknown (critical health implications)

**Current Solutions Fall Short:**
- Traditional DNA tests: Expensive ($99-$299)
- Surname databases: Only 60-73% accurate to broad regions
- Historical records: Incomplete, scattered
- Family stories: Lost across generations

**The Pain:**
> *"I don't know if my ancestors were Yoruba, Akan, or Igbo. I don't know what languages they spoke, what gods they worshipped, or what diseases run in my bloodline."*
> — The experience of millions

---

# Slide 3: The Solution

## Quantum Computing Meets Consciousness Technology

**RootTrace Quantum** uses quantum algorithms to explore 65,536 ancestral pathways simultaneously, increasing regional accuracy from **73% → 85-92%**.

**How It Works:**
1. **Share Your Story** — Family name, traditions, cultural memories
2. **Quantum Processing** — QAOA algorithm explores all possible origins at once
3. **Discover Your Roots** — Detailed ancestry + medical heritage + living descendants

**Without Traditional DNA Testing**
- More accessible ($29 vs $199+)
- Privacy-preserving (no genetic data)
- Culturally-centered (not Eurocentric)
- Medically-actionable (regional health markers)

# Slide 4: The Technology

## Quantum Advantage is Real

### Classical Approach (Current State):
```
Surname "Bradley" → Linear Search
Could be: Ghana | Nigeria | Senegal | Sierra Leone
Accuracy: 73%
```

### Quantum Approach (RootTrace):
```
Surname "Bradley" → Quantum Superposition
Explores simultaneously:
├─ 16 coastal departure regions
├─ 16 ethnic cluster patterns  
├─ 8 migration time periods
├─ 32 surname transformation variants
= 65,536 pathways evaluated at once

Result: 87% probability Fante/Akan, Cape Coast departure 1785-1805
Accuracy: 85-92%
```

**Powered By:**
- 16-qubit quantum circuits
- IBM Quantum Cloud / AWS Braket
- QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)
- 400+ years of historical slave trade data
- Cultural marker pattern recognition
